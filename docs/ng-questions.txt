The function interface is an interface with just one single method. As such, it may be
implicitly converted to a lambda expression. The java.lang.Runnable and java.util.concurrent.Callable are two great examples
of functional interfaces. In practice, the functional interfaces are fragile: if someone adds just one another method to the interface
definition, it will not be functional anymore and compilation process will fail. To overcome this fragility and explicitly declare
the intent of the interface as being functional, Java 8 adds special annotation @FunctionalInterface (all existing interfaces in Java
library have been annotated with @FunctionalInterface as well).
